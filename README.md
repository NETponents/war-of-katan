## What is this repository for?
If you don't want to pay or want the special features of whatever publishing platform we release it to, you may build it yourself here using Visual Studio 2015 and the latest NuGet package of MonoGame. This repository only contains the Win32 version of the game. Linux, Raspberry Pi, Universal Windows Platform, and mobile games are coming soon and will be hosted in separate repositories.
